Livingstone online: illuminating imperial exploration (LO) is an online library and museum about the work of explorer David Livingstone. This site aims to bring light to Livingston’s life work and amplify the voices of black historians and explorers.

The site is meant to be more of a library, or an archive of David Livingstone. As a result, it doesn’t look like a typical website. Instead, you look around and find the information you want about Livingstone. It’s a great design idea for a website, however it’s not clear from the home page that it is about an explorer name David Livingstone. First you must go to the about website tab and click on the introduction to learn about the site’s purpose.

One way to fix this problem would be to put it in the site’s title (Livingstone Online – Life and Works of David Livingstone) or link the ‘about website’ article to the home page. That way people can immediately find out what the site is about. Then viewers can look up the information they want about David Livingstone. 
Another confusing aspect of the website were the tab titles. Life and times are simple enough. However, if the reader doesn’t know who Livingstone is, they may not understand why spectral imaging or in his own words is relevant to the explorer.  For example, when I clicked on in his own words, I assumed it may be a diary/journal entry of some kind. Instead, there were articles about his manuscripts. About how his literary work impacted the exploration narrative in the 18th century. Maybe under the more ambiguous headings the creators could describe it more or change it to something more universally understood.

It didn’t really make sense to title a whole section spectral imaging (SI). SI is the method used to translate the documents into legible writing. Since most of the documents recovered are from before the 19th century, they are impossible to read, and first needed to go through SI to be read and studied. While it is an interesting piece of information, it didn’t need a whole tab dedicated to it. The articles under the tab were documents they recovered using spectral imaging. This website is primarily about an historical figure, not about technology used to recover documents.  It could’ve worked better as a single article under another tab. Another fix could’ve been to put it under the behind-the-scenes tab since spectral imaging is related.

The information on each article is done well. LO provides the sources they used for each article. If the reader goes through the tabs the tabs in left to right order they can see the life, and contributions of David Livingstone in chronologically. The image placement in the articles is well done and illustrates the point of the writing. For example, the article titled “Livingstone's 1871 Field Diary”, speaks about a reporter trying to locate Livingstone and when the reporter finally found Livingstone he said “"Dr. Livingstone, I presume?", and under that paragraph it has a picture of the same quote. Which I thought was good image placement.

Even though it is not meant for the average viewer, they could’ve shorted the word count on some of the articles to make it more accessible for student and scholars looking for information about David Livingstone. LO did lack some of the sophistication and organization needed for a website. However, it was a great informational source on David Livingstone. The Website creators put a lot of time an energy into compiling and gathering information on David Livingston and it shows.
