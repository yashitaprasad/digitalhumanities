### Yashita Prasad
##### Background 
Hi! My name’s Yashita, and a Computer Science Major. I’m a junior here at CNU and a transfer student. 
I took this course to fulfill the writing intensive portion of my degree. I wanted to take digital humanities to improve my professional and academic writing. Digital Humanities sounded like an interesting field, and I’m excited to learn more about it.
Even though I don’t plan on pursuing a career in a writing, English, or Humanities field, it would be helpful further into my academic career to write clear and concisely.(.)
I plan on interning during the summer and then becoming a software developer after graduation. 
##### Fun facts
I lived in Leesburg and then moved to Ashburn for middle and high school. My mother is an accountant, and my father works in business. I have one sibling, a younger brother. Over this winter break I went sledding in my backyard which was fun. 
I used to have fishes when I was younger, although I always wanted a dog (I could never convince my parents to get one).
I recently started watching anime. My current favorite anime would be _Attack on Titan_. So far, I’ve watched _Demon Slayer_, _Jujitsu Kaisen_, _My Hero Academia_ and _Banana Fish_.
