### Yashita Prasad
##### Background 
Hi! My name’s Yashita, and a I’m a Computer Science Major. I’m in my junior here at CNU and a transfer student.


I’m taking this class to satisfy the writing intensive portion of my degree. I wanted to take digital humanities to improve my professional and academic writing. Digital Humanities sounds like an interesting field, and I’m excited to learn more about it. Digital Humanities seemed like an interesting combination of applying principles learned in humanities fields, but instead applying it to the digital world. I started off college as a political science major but switched a semester in when I realized the field wasn’t for me. So, it’s interesting coming back to a humanities class with more experience in college. 


Although I don’t plan on pursuing a career in a writing, English, or a Humanities field, I thought it would be helpful further into my academic career to know how to write clearly and concisely while being formal. Especially when pursuing academic research and internships in the future. 


I plan on completing internships during the summer and then becoming a software developer after graduation.

##### Fun facts
I lived in Leesburg and then moved to Ashburn for middle and high school. My mother is an accountant, and my father works in business. I have one sibling, a younger brother. Over this winter break I went sledding in my backyard which was fun. 


I used to have fishes when I was younger, although I always wanted a dog (I could never convince my parents to get one).


My favorite Marvel superhero is Spider-Man, and I used to play basketball in high school. 


I recently started watching anime. My current favorite anime would be _Attack on Titan_. So far, I’ve watched _Demon Slayer_, _Jujitsu Kaisen_, _My Hero Academia_ and _Banana Fish_.
