For this TEI assignment, I had to code a portion of Dracula’s Guest in Oxygen XML.  Oxygen XML is an easy-to-use markup language and work great for text to code. At first, I didn’t know how it would look coding only a portion of a text, and or how the paragraph tags would work with broken up text. I did have experience coding in python before this project. However, it is different coding text than simply coding a program. It was a nice change in pace from what I’m used to. 


Writing the code in a google doc before copy and pasting it into Oxygen was a very helpful in reducing errors in the text.

Oxygen itself was easy to learn, especially since we did the coding portion in class. The software was on the MacBook laptops in the classroom. I managed to finish the text I was assigned, during the class period. The commands on the MacBook were an adjustment to make because I’m used to using windows when I code. In some ways the MacBook PC system took more adjusting than the code itself. The only problem was I don’t have oxygen on my own laptop, so I had to double check my code on the spot before emailing it to myself.

I enjoyed working on the TEI project. It was interesting converting text into code and have a part in the larger project.
