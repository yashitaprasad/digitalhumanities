I’ve had a great time this semester taking this course. I wasn’t too familiar with the Digital Humanities Field and didn’t know what we would be doing. At first Digital Humanities seemed like any humanities subject that had some relation technology, and/or used technology to educate its audience. Now, the first point still holds, Digital Humanities is the intersection of technology with the humanities however just because a project uses technology doesn’t automatically make it a DH project. 


The readings we did for homework were great for the most part. They varied from short stories, advice on how to write a grant, and DH, projects. The ones I found the most helpful were the articles that advised how to approach grant writing, and the DH projects. They helped expand my view of Digital Humanities outside the classroom, and how the concepts we learned in class were applied in different settings. For example, Katherine Hepworth and Christopher Church, “Racism in the Machine: Visualization Ethics in Digital Humanities Projects” showed how the way technology is used could indicate implicit bias. Everything from the colors used in a project, to the way data is represented in a project could impact the way the audience views the information. 


Some of the reading while offering great information, were longer and more tedious to get through. For example, Charlotte Roueché, “Why Do We Mark up Texts?” provided great historical context for why we annotate the materials we are reading. However, it was eight pages long and repeated the same points. It didn’t really provide new information, because annotating to some extent is self-explanatory. The article was well written, which was good. Overall, despite my concerns I still enjoyed reading the material. 


The readings supplemented my understanding of the course, by expanding what type of writings and projects could be under Digital Humanities. Another interesting assignment was reviewing a DH related website. This was great because we looked in depth into a project of our choosing and examining whether they met the criteria of a good DH website. This was helpful because I used what I learned from doing this project and applied to my grant proposal to make sure my own project was a good DH project. 


Another interesting thing in this course, were our blogs that that we completed using GitHub. It was a nice change in pace to post our reviews, instead of turning in a paper. Markdown was simple to use and became second nature to use at the end of the semester. 


Tweets were a great way to stay updated with the assignments. It was a nice change of pace from assignments we usually do in English classes. Staying up to date and tweeting throughout the week could be challenging sometimes. It was tempting to try to get them all done in one day and not have to worry about it later, however that would defeat the purpose of tweeting and doing assigned readings before class. 


Later in class, we worked on our own grant proposals. At first it seemed really intimidating because there were a lot of moving parts. However, when we worked on it in class, and got feedback during office hours it was far more manageable. It was great getting to pick what we wanted to work on. I choose a mapping project of an anime that I liked. At first it was tricky what material I wanted cover in the map, and what were the foundational themes in my project. However, the more I started writing, and stepping through what a potential interactive map would look like it was easier to figure out what I wanted to do with my project. 


I’ve improved my writing by learning how to write clearly and concisely, while still thoroughly explaining what points I had to make. My grant proposal helped me the most, because we couldn’t go over 1000 words and had a good amount of material to explain. It helped me prioritize what was relevant to explain in a project, and what could be cut. 


Another resource that helped write more clearly, was the Hemingway app. In the Hemingway app you type the text you want reviewed in the box, and the app gives you a grade from 1-12 on the readability of your text. The number represent the grade level that you text is at. 1 is a 1ST grade level and 12 is a 12th grade level. You want somewhere between 6-8, because that is the most accessible audience. This app was a great resource, that helped me improve my writing. 


Overall, I learned a lot in this course and really enjoyed taking it.
